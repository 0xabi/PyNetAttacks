# PyNetAttacks
This repository contains Python scripts to simulate various network protocols attacks and IEEE 802.11 attacks.

Detailed experiments here: [0xabi Gitbook - PyNetAttacks](https://0xabi.gitbook.io/notes/projects/pynetattacks)

**Network Protocols Attacks**: ICMP Smurf Attack, ICMP Redirect Attack, ARP Cache Poisoning, TCP SYN Flood Attack, TCP RST Attack, TCP Session Hijacking, DNS Local Poisoning, DNS Cache Poisoning, DNS Rebinding Attack, BGP Prefix Attack.

**IEEE 802.11 Attacks**: Deauth. Attack, Autoimmune disorder, Power Save Attack, Virtual Carrier Sensing Attack, BlockACK, Channel Switch Attack, ATIM Attack.
